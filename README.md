# Vue CLI Plugin Carlo
> Turn your Vue CLI 3 SPA into a desktop app with [carlo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo).


**IMPORTANT: Your app must be created with Vue-CLI 3 (`vue create my-app`), will not work with Vue-CLI 2 (`vue init webpack my-app`)!**

## Quick Start:

Open a terminal in the directory of your app created with Vue-CLI 3.

Then, install and invoke the generator of vue-cli-plugin-carlo by running:

`vue add carlo`

That's It! You're ready to go!

### To start a development server:

If you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (strongly recommended):

`yarn carlo:serve`

or if you use NPM:

`npm run carlo:serve`

### To build your app:

With Yarn:

`yarn carlo:build`

or with NPM:

`npm run carlo:build`
